JorNyece Cox resume and portfolio of my work.
Hello,
I am JorNyece Cox and I am a senior Computer Science student with a specialization in management and a minor in math.
This respository is a portfolio of some of my coding projects that I have done while I have been in school.
I am currently looking for jobs were I can use my management specializtion in  my future work field, but also 
still have that strong connection with technology.
